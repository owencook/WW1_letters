To the Dearest Ones at Home

No doubt you have heard that I have been wounded. I have sent a letter card to Will and also asked Auntie Lill to let you know. Well I received a nasty smack in the mouth from a machine gun bullet on the night of the 4th of August. Oh mother it was just hell we charged the Germans at about 9.15 p.m. I was alright till about 9.30 when we took the Germans first line where I got the smack the bullet entering just below my left ear and coming out on my right jaw. I bled considerably having to go under chloroform to have it stopped.
The bullet smashed 2 of my teeth and splintered my jaw also cutting my tonsils, but thank God I was very lucky; a little bit higher it would have gone through my temple and a little lower it would have broken both my jas, I have a lot to be thankful for, this is the second charge I have been in lately one on the 28th July and one on the 4th August our Brigade was cut up terribly, 3 battalions went in the first charge with about (censored) strong we came out less than (censored) strong and I really don't know how we came off this time all I know is that we gave Mr Hun a jolly bad time taking two lines of trenches from him. Perse Thomas was wounded just above the knee, I don't know how P. Ainsworth got on. I lost a great number of friends killed and wounded one chap I know from Binna Burra, Simmons by name was killed. 
(Binna Burra only about a mile and a half from Brooklet.)

A teacher at the Bellimbopinni Public School in 1916 was one Hugh McInnis. 


Sir,

There are persistent rumours in the Kempsy District the the private whose name is given above has been Courtmartialled and shot in Egypt for threatening to shoot his superior officer.

Is there any truth in this report, (which I cannot believe)? He was always in the habit of writing to his mother, but the last letter we had from him was dated Gallipoli 9th November 1915. Neither his mother or myself have received any communication about it therefore I believe it to be a cruel lie. Awaiting your reply and thanking you in anticipation

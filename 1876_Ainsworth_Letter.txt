We attacked the Germans on the 28th July, at 16 minutes passed 12 midnight, and we who are still alive will never forget that night. We jumped out of our own line at 16 minutes passed 12. At 3 am. were compelled to retire by the worst of bad luck. It was the 6th and 7thBrigades who attacked & our job was to take 2 lines of trenches (1,000 yds) on a 1200 yard front. Well we rerached & took their first line but when we got to their 2nd line, we found their wire wasn't cut, there was nothing to do, but go back with machine guns & artillery on us the whole time. We reached our own lines at 3.30 a.m. & lost very heavily. Amongst those killed in that charge was Mick Simmons

(Milton Simmons was called Mick as much as Milton around here)
